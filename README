This syntax script was based on the script originally written by James Kidd years ago. The mechanism for matching SAS keywords has been completely rewritten. The new approach is supposed to be more sophisticated and content sensitive than the old one. 

New improvements of the latest syntax script:

1. Keywords newly introduced in SAS 9.1/9.2/9.3 have been added, including ODS statements, hash object, Proc SGPLOT and Proc SGPANEL.
2. All keywords (according to SAS official documents) in base SAS (up to 9.3) have been supported.
3. Highlights for format tags, user defined macro functions, and macro comments have been supported.

I omitted syntax supports for SAS log and list files in this script. Syntax supports for these files should be kept in separate scripts.  

Please let me know if there is any bugs in the script.
